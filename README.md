# odin-recipes

View the website live: https://stonkszain.github.io/odin-recipes/

This website consists of a main index page which will have links to different recipes. It consists of pure HTML

This project is part of The Odin Project
I am trying to solidify my foundations in HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that I can confidenly build any website from a mockup
