        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450g) boneless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken:
                In a bowl, combine yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, smoked paprika, cumin, coriander, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well to create the marinade. Add the chicken pieces and coat them thoroughly with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Preheat the Grill or Oven:
                If grilling, preheat the grill to medium-high heat. If using an oven, preheat it to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the Chicken:
                For grilling, thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers. Grill the chicken for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a nicely charred exterior.
                
                If using an oven, place the chicken pieces on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked and has a slight char on the edges.</li>
            <li>Serve and Garnish:
                Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill or oven. Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves. Serve the Bangin Chicken Tikka with lemon wedges on the side for an extra burst of flavor. This dish pairs wonderfully with naan, rice, or a refreshing cucumber and tomato salad.</li>
