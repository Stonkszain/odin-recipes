        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Smooth Spicy Shawerma is a tantalizing blend of tender, marinated slices of meat, infused with aromatic spices and served in soft pita bread. The combination of smooth flavors and a hint of spice makes this dish a perfect comfort food with a Middle Eastern twist.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450g) boneless chicken thighs or beef/lamb slices</li>
            <li>4-6 pita bread rounds</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Meat:
                In a bowl, combine yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create the marinade. Add the sliced meat and ensure it's coated evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Preheat the Grill or Skillet:
                If grilling, preheat the grill to medium-high heat. If using a skillet, heat it over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the Meat:
                For grilling, thread the marinated meat onto skewers and grill for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and slightly charred.
                
                If using a skillet, heat a small amount of oil and cook the marinated meat slices for about 4-5 minutes per side, until cooked through and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Shawerma:
                Warm the pita bread rounds. Lay a pita on a flat surface. Place a few slices of cooked meat in the center of the pita. Top with sliced tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers. Garnish with fresh parsley or mint leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy:
                Optionally, drizzle tahini sauce or garlic sauce over the meat and veggies for an extra layer of flavor. Roll the pita tightly around the fillings to form a shawerma wrap. Serve immediately and savor the delightful blend of smooth and spicy flavors.</li>
            
        </ol>
